5. ML service:
   - Runs image through classification model
   - Generates confidence scores
   - Selects top match and alternatives
6. Results are returned to API
7. API enriches results with plant database information

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling of API servers through auto-scaling groups
- Read replicas for database scaling
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed plant data
- CDN for static content delivery
- Background job processing for non-real-time tasks
- Efficient image processing pipeline

## Security Measures

- Feature flags for controlled rollouts

## Future Architecture Considerations

- Microservices migration path
- GraphQL API layer
- Real-time collaboration features
- Offline functionality
- AR capabilities for in-situ plant visualization
- Expanded ML capabilities for disease detection

## Conclusion

The Plantfinder architecture is designed for scalability, reliability, and extensibility. The separation of concerns between the frontend, backend, and ML components allows for independent scaling and development of each area. The cloud-native approach ensures the system can grow with user demand while maintaining performance and security.
